# NgrxBasic

This project was created with Nrwl Nx 0.7.4 using Angular CLI 1.6.5

## What is it for

Since Typescript 2.6 there is the option for strict function types --strictFunctionTypes.
This option will be included when using "strict": true in the tsconfig.json.

The strict checking might become standard for future Angular / CLI versions.

When compiling a project with ngrx included these checks will cause a lot of problems in regards to type checking.

With this project I want to show the manual changes to be made to the ngrx implemention to get it compiled.
